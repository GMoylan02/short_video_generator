00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:00,800
to fu by

1
00:00:00,927 --> 00:00:02,207
explaining my synesthesia

2
00:00:02,303 --> 00:00:03,039
to my boyfriend

3
00:00:03,135 --> 00:00:03,680
I have Grafton

4
00:00:03,776 --> 00:00:05,184
color synesthesia basically

5
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:05,920
I see letters

6
00:00:06,047 --> 00:00:06,688
and numbers and

7
00:00:06,751 --> 00:00:07,455
colors the letter

8
00:00:07,552 --> 00:00:08,288
e being green

9
00:00:08,383 --> 00:00:09,407
for example a

10
00:00:09,536 --> 00:00:10,336
couple months ago

11
00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:11,232
I was explaining

12
00:00:11,295 --> 00:00:11,552
it to my

13
00:00:11,711 --> 00:00:12,479
boyfriend whose a

14
00:00:12,576 --> 00:00:12,864
bit of a

15
00:00:12,895 --> 00:00:13,696
skeptic he asked

16
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:14,272
me what color

17
00:00:14,368 --> 00:00:15,263
certain letters and

18
00:00:15,295 --> 00:00:16,191
numbers were and

19
00:00:16,224 --> 00:00:16,736
had me write

20
00:00:16,799 --> 00:00:17,888
them down since

21
00:00:17,983 --> 00:00:18,815
then he'll randomly

22
00:00:18,912 --> 00:00:19,615
quiz me and

23
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:20,416
compare my answer

24
00:00:20,511 --> 00:00:20,832
to what I

25
00:00:20,927 --> 00:00:21,312
said a few

26
00:00:21,408 --> 00:00:22,304
months ago always

27
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:22,975
being the same

28
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:24,288
atia's course he

29
00:00:24,416 --> 00:00:25,024
still seemed a

30
00:00:25,087 --> 00:00:25,888
bit skeptic as

31
00:00:25,951 --> 00:00:26,431
if maybe I

32
00:00:26,591 --> 00:00:27,520
just memorized them

33
00:00:27,615 --> 00:00:28,544
really really well

34
00:00:29,312 --> 00:00:29,888
tonight we were

35
00:00:30,016 --> 00:00:30,719
laying in bed

36
00:00:30,912 --> 00:00:31,711
and my boyfriend

37
00:00:31,775 --> 00:00:32,576
quizzed me again

38
00:00:33,023 --> 00:00:33,919
I tried explaining

39
00:00:33,984 --> 00:00:34,335
to him I

40
00:00:34,495 --> 00:00:34,944
just see the

41
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,319
colors automatically when

42
00:00:36,416 --> 00:00:37,183
I visualized the

43
00:00:37,248 --> 00:00:37,791
letters in my

44
00:00:37,888 --> 00:00:38,464
head I asked

45
00:00:38,495 --> 00:00:39,104
him what color

46
00:00:39,231 --> 00:00:39,776
are the letters

47
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:40,383
in his head

48
00:00:40,832 --> 00:00:41,312
he looked at

49
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:42,080
me weirdly like

50
00:00:42,144 --> 00:00:42,464
what do you

51
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:42,976
mean in my

52
00:00:43,104 --> 00:00:44,063
head that's not

53
00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:45,279
a thing my

54
00:00:45,439 --> 00:00:46,720
boyfriend didn't understand

55
00:00:46,784 --> 00:00:47,200
what I meant

56
00:00:47,263 --> 00:00:48,256
by visualizing the

57
00:00:48,352 --> 00:00:49,599
letters he didn't

58
00:00:49,631 --> 00:00:50,271
believe me that

59
00:00:50,335 --> 00:00:51,136
I can visualize

60
00:00:51,231 --> 00:00:52,000
letters or even

61
00:00:52,096 --> 00:00:53,279
visualize anything in

62
00:00:53,375 --> 00:00:54,880
my head turns

63
00:00:54,976 --> 00:00:55,807
out my boyfriend

64
00:00:55,872 --> 00:00:56,639
has Athen Tejo

65
00:00:56,799 --> 00:00:57,439
when he tries

66
00:00:57,504 --> 00:00:58,431
to visualize stuff

67
00:00:58,495 --> 00:00:59,071
he just sees

68
00:00:59,167 --> 00:01:00,543
blackness he can't

69
00:01:00,639 --> 00:01:01,472
picture anything in

70
00:01:01,568 --> 00:01:02,240
his mind and

71
00:01:02,304 --> 00:01:03,104
thought that everyone

72
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:03,616
else had it

73
00:01:03,647 --> 00:01:04,096
the same way

74
00:01:04,223 --> 00:01:04,608
he thought it

75
00:01:04,671 --> 00:01:05,152
was just an

76
00:01:05,248 --> 00:01:06,015
expression to say

77
00:01:06,143 --> 00:01:06,975
picture this or

78
00:01:07,103 --> 00:01:08,639
etc it's crazy

79
00:01:08,736 --> 00:01:09,087
to him the

80
00:01:09,183 --> 00:01:09,599
fact that I

81
00:01:09,695 --> 00:01:10,367
can picture his

82
00:01:10,463 --> 00:01:11,391
face without looking

83
00:01:11,456 --> 00:01:12,000
at him or

84
00:01:12,096 --> 00:01:12,896
a banana without

85
00:01:12,991 --> 00:01:13,503
looking at it

86
00:01:14,335 --> 00:01:14,879
now I have

87
00:01:14,944 --> 00:01:15,807
a boyfriend that

88
00:01:15,903 --> 00:01:16,832
is really upset

89
00:01:17,279 --> 00:01:18,015
he feels like

90
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:18,688
his world is

91
00:01:18,783 --> 00:01:19,744
turned upside down

92
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,055
and everybody else

93
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:21,695
has this cool

94
00:01:21,791 --> 00:01:23,199
superpower he's been

95
00:01:23,295 --> 00:01:24,160
texting all his

96
00:01:24,223 --> 00:01:24,832
friends and see

97
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:25,248
if they can

98
00:01:25,344 --> 00:01:26,304
imagine stuff and

99
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,295
realizing I was

100
00:01:27,328 --> 00:01:27,935
that pulling his

101
00:01:28,031 --> 00:01:28,704
chain has pretty

102
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:29,536
upset and I

103
00:01:29,664 --> 00:01:30,592
feel really bad
